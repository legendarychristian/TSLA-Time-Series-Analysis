### basic time series analysis on the tesla stock price

this is me just learning the beginnings about machine learning and stocks

so, it's all super basic...

but that's not the point!

the point is... this is all going to lead to something bigger and greater

alas, here are the directions this code is pointing me

### models, models, and jessica alba ;)

  i spent a lot of time researching different what a quantative analysist does
  
  and what i found may shock you
  
  they don't do shit
  
  they just look at numbers and guess...
  
  there is no magic formula. no secret field of math. no nothing. no cookie. it's all just bells and whistles. 
  
  stupid fucking idiots.
  
  they have different "parameters" that they all look at, but that's probably it. 
  
  so... where do we go from here.
  
  SIMPLE! we replace quantative analysists, with machine learning models.
  
  i want HUNDREDS of programs, all using different machine learning algorithms, all looking at different sets of parameters, and all WORKING together to predict whatever i want

### parameters are power!

  feature analysis man that's where the fucking money is. 

  i need to be plugging and chugging as many possible combinations of features into this machine learning algorithm as possible

  now i just need to find what features i want to test 

### where do neural nets fit in all of this?

  i have no fucking clue

  right now, neural nets and transformers are ALL POWERFUL

  so why am i investing time looking at machine learning models?
  
  i don't know

  i need to figure out where neural nets fit in all of this 

### more things i need to know

  i need to figure out how to tune hyperparemeters for these models 

  need to figure out how to add more features

  need to have an understanding of the types of models and what scenarios they are best used for
